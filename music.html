			<h2 class="header">me as a musician</h2>

			<p>
				I've <i>loved</i> music since I was a child. Especially learning
				instruments and music style: I'm no multi-instrumentalist, but
				there's something truly special about the process of finding
				your voice on a new instrument.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'm currently focusing on learning the electric guitar, and this
				journey has taken me through time and space â€” I know it sounds
				corny, but bear with me.

				I used to have unreasonable distaste for trap/hip-hop, and
				unexpectedly, the guitar (more accurately, the band Polyphia)
				opened my eyes (and ears!) to the genre through metal-trap-latin
				fusion music.

			<p>
				^ Here I am making a fool of myself playing one of their harder
				songs. Polyphia's music is dizzyingly technical, and this has
				really pushed me to grow â€” at least I think it has!

			<p>
				Truthfully though, I'm a jazz player at heart. The saxophone and
				jazz have shaped my musical taste. So sometimes I try to bring
				out my voice as a saxophonist on the guitar.

				^ This is one of my favourite R&B-ish tunes I've recorded. This
				kind of stuff is incredibly fun to play and teaches harmony, to
				me, in a way that's a lot more accessible than studying jazz
				theory.
